## Installation

::: panel-tabset

## SDU

If your computer was issued by the SDU IT department with MS Windows as the operating system, you can install R via SDUs _Software Center_.

In that case, you should install RTools along with R, if it is available. Ensure, that you download the version of RTools that correspond to you version of R (4.2 or 4.3, etc).

## Windows

R can be downloaded from the internet via this link [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/):

(Note, that access to the CRAN website may be restricted on the Region Syd network -- use the wireless _Gæstenet_ instead)

-   Near the top, you will find the link **Download R for Windows**.
-   Click the link and download hte file
-   Once the file is downloaded, install as per usual procedure

You should also install RTools along with R - make sure you use the version appropriate for you installation of R -- [Link to RTools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/).

## MacOS

R can be downloaded from the internet via this link [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/):

(Note, that access to the CRAN website may be restricted on the Region Syd network -- use the wireless _Gæstenet_ instead)

-   Near the top, you will find the link **Download R for MacOS**.
-   Click the link and download hte file
-   Once the file is downloaded, install as per usual procedure

## Linux

(Note, that access to the CRAN website may be restricted on the Region Syd network -- use the wireless _Gæstenet_ instead)

R is, in all probablity, already part of your preferred Linux distributions software repositories. If you use a Debian based distribution, it should be as simple as::

```{bash}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

user@linux$ sudo apt install r-base

```

If you want to generate literature references (pandoc) and/or generate PDF output (texlive), you probably also want the following software installed:

```{bash}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

user@linux$ sudo apt install pandoc pandoc-citeproc texlive-base texlive-extra-utils texlive-font-utils texlive-fonts-recommended texlive-fonts-extra texlive-latex-base texlive-latex-extra texlive-latex-recommended texlive-pictures texlive-pstricks texlive-xetex lmodern texlive-lang-european g++ libxml2-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libssl-dev 

```

If you are using another distribution (Arch, Red Hat, etc) you simply need to install the same software using their package managers (yum, rpm, etc)

## Check that R is installed and working

If the installation process completed as expected, you should now have a working R environment on your computer -- before we go any further, it is a good idea to confirm that:

::: panel-tabset

## Windows

To confirm that R is installed and working, click the Start menu, scroll to R and open the r gui interface. Check the R installation version number.

![](gfx/windows_check_installation.webm)

## MacOS

To confirm that R was installed and working on your MacOS, first open a *Terminal*:

You can find the *Terminal* in *Utilities* under *Applications* or your can hold down the *Command* key while pressing *space* to open *Spotlight* and enter "Terminal" -- then double click the appropriate search result.

In the MacOS *Terminal* type:

```{bash}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

...SKAF BILLEDE FRA EN MAC
```

## Linux

Open your favorite *command-line interface* and try this:

```{bash}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

user@linux: R
```

The output should look something like this:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
