## Important

The company Posit which develops RStudio (and a great many R packages), also offer an online version of RStudio and the R ecosystem, called _Posit Cloud_.

> Posit Cloud (formerly RStudio Cloud) lets you access Posit’s powerful set of data science tools right in your browser – no installation or complex configuration required.

They even offer a free (as in free beer) version with some limitations. However, we recommend you install R, RStudio, etc on your own computer unless there are very specific reasons to choose a cloud hosted solution.
