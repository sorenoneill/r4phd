## Welcome to R4phd

The idea behind this webpage was to form the basis for regular classroom teaching of R, RStudio and the R ecosystem. Primarily with Ph.D. courses based at the University of Southern Denmak in mind.

You will find a plethora of guides, examples, videos and FAQs on the internet, but it can be difficult to naviagte and it is not structured for classroom teaching.

<hr>

You can start by looking at the table of content in the collapsable menu (top-left hand corner).

## How to use this website

## Operating system -- Windows, MacOS or Linux?

The teaching material on this site was prepared mainly on a Linux computer.

If you use Microsoft Windows or Apple MacOS you should expect things to look sightly different here, from how they appear on your own screen.

It should not give rise to any important issues however, as R and RStudio work very well and almost identically on all three operating systems. None-the-less, where I am aware of any real differences between the operating systems, I will illustrate it using three tabs in the following way (click the relevant tab):

::: panel-tabset

### Windows

...Windows specific content

### MacOS

...MacOS specific content

### Linux

...Linux specific content

## Exercises

On occasion you will find small exercises in collapsible boxes, like this:

(Click the collapsible box below):

:::{.callout-note collapse=true}

### Exercise #1

**If there are important differences between Windows, MacOS and Linux, you can find the information relevant to you:**

* In a separate window marked by a warning-triangle
* In one of three tabs marked with the operating system
* On a postcard on the fridge in the canteen

:::

... and similarly, the solution will be found in a collapsable box:

:::{.callout-note collapse=true}

### Solution to exercise #1

* ~~In a separate window marked by a warning-triangle~~
* **In one of three tabs marked with the operating system**
* ~~On a postcard on the fridge in the canteen~~
