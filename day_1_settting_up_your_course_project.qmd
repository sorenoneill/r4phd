# Setting up your course project {#sec-setup}
Follow these instructions step by step: 

1. Start a new project. Think about the name and where you place the project. You are going to be using this project a lot. (Important: project_and_folder_names_matter)
1. Create a folder in the project called `raw_data`  
1. Create a folder in the project called `clean_data`  
1. Create a folder in the project called `scripts`  
1. Place the `ANSUR_II.csv` file from ItsLearning in the `raw_data` folder  
1. Create an R script (File -> New File -> R script), save it in the `scripts` folder and call it `01_import.R`  
1. Close the R script you just created and leave it for now.  
\
This file and folder structure is a basic setup that will work for most projects. We will return to this later today, and on day 4 you will learn how to improve this setup even further.
\
*  Discuss with you neighbor what the meaning of this madness can be about?

# Setting up your course project (continued)

Have you completed the wrangling exercises for `select()`, `filter()`, `summarise()`, `group_by()`, `arrange()`, and `mutate()` ?

\

Great - now you have the skills to continue the work we started in @sec-setup.\
This coming task is important for the rest of your course.\
\
As you have noticed the `ANSUR_II` dataset is not perfect when we load it, e.g., `Height` is measured in inches, `Weightkg` is measured in Kg\*10, etc..\
Therefore, we need to change a few things before we can start our work. It is essential in datascience and research that this process is documented and reproducible.\
\

* Open the R script `01_import.R` that you created in @sec-setup.\
* For the rest of this section you are going to work in this R script. 


### Write the necessary code to import the `ANSUR_II.csv` file and update the data

**Write comments and explain your code as you solve the steps below**

* add `heightcm` (height in cm)
* fix `weightkg`
* add `BMI`
* add `category` (level of BMI)
* add `race` - Base the values in race on the description below
* remove `Heightin`
* place the variables in an order that you like (use `relocate()`)
* make sure that all changes are assigned to `ANSUR_II`

## `race` in `ANSUR_II`

`DODRace` is a variable in the `ANSUR_II` dataset. The description is given below:\ 

`DODRace` – Department of Defense Race; a single digit indicating a subject’s
self-reported preferred single race where selecting multiple races is not an option.
This variable is intended to be comparable to the Defense Manpower Data Center
demographic data. Where 1 = White, 2 = Black, 3 = Hispanic, 4 = Asian,
5 = Native American, 6 = Pacific Islander, 8 = Other
