# RedCap

## Data structure

The data will be exported as a standard [csv file](intro_load_csv_en.qmd). 

The csv file will be accompanied by an R script file, which will read the csv file and wrangle the data into an R data frame called 'data'.

You can run the R script once to generate the 'data' data frame and export to an RDS file and load that into your own R scripts.

**Note** The R script file depends on the `Hmisc` package being installed.

## Direct database access

It is possible to access the REDCap database directly from R code. See [this link](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/REDCapR/REDCapR.pdf) for more information. 

This will also require a valid access token. The REDCap administrator should be able to provide you with such a token, if permitted.
