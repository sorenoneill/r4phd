## RDS

* RDS is short for _R Data Serialization_ -- that means data which is complex in nature and asymmetrical such as e.g. a list of lists of variable lengths, can be serialized and stored easily.
* RDS is _not_ a simple text file -- it is a compressed format not well suited for human readers
* RDS is however, a simple and efficient way to store and retrieve data which already exist in R memory.
