# Hints for working in the console

As mentioned elsewhere, the console lets you _talk_ directly to the R interpreter and you will spend much time in the console testing out your code.

Here follows a number of practical simple hints on how to use the console:

## Predictive texting

![Write `mean` in the console and wait a short while -- RStudio will present you with a list of functions etc in the current environment that starts with _mean_. Try scrolling through the list.](gfx/mouse_over_list.gif)

<hr>

## Predictive texting .. which is adaptive

![Write `meaning_of_life <- 52` (ENTER) to create a new variable -- now try out hint #1 again and you will see this new variable has been added to the list.](gfx/mouse_over_list_2.gif)

<hr>

## Re-use and ammend previous commands

But the meaning of life is not 52, is it?[^1] So we need to fix that. 

![In the console on an empty line, simply press the keyboard up-arrow and your previous command should re-appear, amend it to 42 and press ENTER. You can use the arrows to scroll up/down through a history of you console commands, in the current session.](gfx/history_keys.gif)

<hr>

## Sweeping away the clutter

![In the top right hand corner of the console click the icon which resembles a broom. It clears the console window, but the console hisotry is retained.](gfx/clear_console.gif)

<hr>

## Running a command from the text editor

![Open an empty R script in the text editor, enter `print("copy, paste, execute")` (CTRL+ENTER) -- this command should be copied into the console and executed immediately.](gfx/ctrl-enter.gif)

<hr>

## Running multiple commands from the text editor

![In the text editor add another line below the first one: `print("with CTRL-ENTER")` -- this time, highlight both lines (mouse: click+drag) before CTRL+ENTER.](gfx/ctrl-enter_2.gif)

**Hint** Check out the 'Run' dropdown button in the top right-hand corner of the text editor, to run all code or specific chunks.

<hr>

To copy the other way, from console to text editor, use the usual mouse-hightlight, CTRL-c and CTRL-v to copy paste.

[^1]: According to the fictional supercomputer Deep Thought in Douglas Adams' sci-fi universe, The Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, The Universe, and Everything, is 42, but you probably already knew that :-)
