# Hints for working in the text editor 

## Working in Quarto markdown documents

![Highlighted areas in the text editor (quarto document)](gfx/quarto_in_text_editor.png)

When working in a quarto document, the text should be divided into one (and only one) _YAML_ at the beginning of the document. The YAML is delimited by two lines consisting of `---`. 

Below the YAML, the text will consist of markdown, with any number of inserted R chunks. Notice, the difference in background colour (which is contingent upon the chosen _Editor Theme_ in _Tools_ / _Global Options_ / _Appearance_).

Each R chunk is delimited by lines of ```` ```{r} ```` and ```` ``` ````. 

Notice the _inline_ r-code in line 15 (orange box), which is delimited by `` `r `` and `` ` ``.

## Visual versus Source code

Try out the buttons `Visual` and `Source` in the top left hand corner. Also note the YAML line `editor`(line 4), which sets the default choice for visual versus source editor.

## Document outline

Notice the icon `Outline` in the top right hand corner, which shows/hides a hierachial outline of the documents headings.

## Code outline

Also notice the icon in the bottom left hand corner (purple box) -- in the illustration above it is entitled 'Subheading', but this dynamically changes contingent upon where the cursor is located.
