# Data types - why it matters

R is constructed to work with a number of _basic_ data types:

* logical : TRUE or FALSE
* integer : whole numbers
* numeric : decimal numbers
* complex : complex numbers 
* character : alphabetic and other characters
* raw : byte data

It is important to use the right data type for your data management and analyses.

It is also important to _know_ the type of the data you are working with, otherwise you may get confusing output. We will see examples of this later.

## Logical (or boolean)

Assumes either `TRUE` or `FALSE`.

**Note** That logical values can also be regarded as _integer_ values 1 and 0, corresponding to `TRUE` and `FALSE`.

Look at this code and its output:

```{r logical}
a <- TRUE
a+3
```
