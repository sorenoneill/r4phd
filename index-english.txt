## Welcome to R4phd

The idea of this website was to provide the basis for regular class-room courses in R, RStudio and the rest of the R-ecosystem. Primarily with Ph.D. courses at the Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Southern Denmark in mind. 

There is already a plethora of guides, examples, videos, FAQ and more available online, but it can be difficult to navigate _and_ I consider it important to provide Danish language materials for students at a Danish university -- none-the-less, I'll provide an English translation as well. Unfortunately, I do not speak any other languages.

For starters -- check out the table of content in the fold-out menu (top left hand corner).

## How to navigate this webpage

## Operating system -- Windows, MacOS or Linux?

This material was prepared on a Linux computer.

If you are using Microsoft Windows or Apple MacOS you should expect the video examples to look slightly different than software will appear on your computer.

This should not give rise to any issues however, as R and RStudio work fine on all three platforms, however where I am aware of any significant differences between operating systems, I will highlight this by using three different tabs, like this (click the relevant tab below):

::: panel-tabset
### Windows

...Windows specific content

### MacOS

...MacOS specific content

### Linux

...Linux specific content

## Exercvises

In places, you will find small exercises embedded in expandable boxes like these:

**If there are important difference between Windows, MacOS and Linux, you can find relevant information:**

* On a postcard on the fridge in the canteen

... and you will find the solution in a similar expandable box.
