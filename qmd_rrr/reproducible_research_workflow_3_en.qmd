# Collaboration

## Collaborating with other researchers

Three scenarios :

* Your collaborators do _not_ use the R ecosystem (booh!)
* Your collaborators use the R ecosystem (woohoo!)
* You and your collaborators are hardcore nerds (git!)

## Collaborating with R-agnostic colleagues

* Render your R-markdown code into a Word or OpenDocument file ... send it via email or carrier-pidgeon
* Collaborators can use _Track changes_ in their chosen word-processor and ... return it
* You then manually transfer changes back to your rmd ... start the process over again for the next time

**Benefits**

* Simple
* No new tools to learn for R-agnostic colleagues
* Anyone can join in 
* Separation of comments and revisions

**Drawbacks**

* Error prone
* Redundancy
* Messy versioning nightmare
* Focus shifts towards typesetting / presentation

## Collaborating with R users

* Get your rmd files (data files etc) and ... send it
* Collaborators edit the qmd directly and ... return it
* _Diff_ the two version of the rmd file and ... merge them selectively

### Diff'ing two (or more) text files

Some very nice and useful apps will let you see and merge differences between two versions of the same text (qmd) files:

* **Meld**
* Beyond compare
* Araxis merge
* P4Merge
* DeltaWalker
* ..and others

There are also several online version .. e.g. **https://editor.mergely.com/** ...you probably should not upload sensitive information though.

**Benefits**

* Relatively simple
* New tools are easy learn
* Anyone can join in
* Only one file type for all collaborators
* Focus remains on content

**Drawback**

* Still some redundancy (qmd file versions)
* Messy versioning nightmare
* Comments and revisions are not clearly separated 

## Tech savvy collaborators 

Use an online GIT repository like [github](https://github.com) or SDUs self-hosted [gitlab](https://gitlab.sdu.dk) server -- you will need to contact IT support for an account.

**Benefits**

* Top tier reproducible research
* World class version control
* No redundancy and clean working directories

**Drawback**

* Let's face it -- it's a bit of a learning curve :-)
