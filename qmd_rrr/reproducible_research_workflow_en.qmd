# Reproducible Research

Let's say you have noticed a wrong entry in your data set ... in invalid CPR number. You might decide to delete the observation from your data like this:

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

data <- read.csv("my_data_file.csv")
# excluded as participant entered an invalid CPR number
data <- data %>% filter(id != "2321369-1212")
```

_...but why not just delete that observation from the csv file?_

:::{.callout-note collapse=true}

## Reproducible Research

The principles of Reproducible Research admonish you that the **entire process** from raw data to output should be:

- scripted
- reproducible
- reversible

What happens when at 6 months later, someone notices that you downloaded 106 rows of data from RedCap, but your manuscript reports n=105? Do you think you'll remember then?

Or for a more dramatic example, look at this youtube video {{< video https://youtu.be/d2Tm3Yx4HWI >}} when you have the time (~20 minutes)
