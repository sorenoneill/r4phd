# Workflow and documentation in RR

<!-- -->

## Automation

The **entire process** from raw data to output should be:

>- scripted
>- reproducible
>- reversible

## Automation

The **entire process** from raw data to output should be:

- scripted
- reproducible
- reversible.

E.g. 

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
data <- read.csv("my_data_file.csv")
# excluded as participant entered an invalid CPR number
data <- data %>% filter(id != "2321369-1212")
```

_..but why not just delete that observation in raw data..?_



## Scripted workflows

![](gfx/data-science-explore.png)


## Load and clean data

# Structuring workflow

<!-- -->


# Working with literature citations

## BibTeX, csl, zotero and friends

<!-- -->

## BibTeX

A simple human readable text file format for references

* Export directly from PubMED and others
* Export from Zotero, EndNote(?) and others

## Zotero

An open source, free reference manager -- well integrated with firefox.

Allows for shared libraries.

Plugin _BetterBibTex_ for ... well, better bibTeX.

Alternatives: Mendeley (Elsevier), EndNote, RefManager, etc

## Zotero

### Let me demonstrate...

* how to find a new reference
* include it in zoteros library
* automatically update bibTeX file (per project)
* cite in Rmd file

## Zotero got style!

Loads of styles ... 10.000+ ... from APA to Ugeskrift for Læger

...and you can write your own if need be.

https://www.zotero.org/styles

## Exercise 

(without Zotero) 

* You have decided to include an extra citation in the main_v1.qmd file
    - Go to scholar.google.com
    - Search for 'What low back pain is and why we need to pay attention'
    - Go to science direct and click 'Cite' to get bibtex
    - Copy bibtex content to your reference file
    - Copy the BibTeX identifier and insert it as a citation
    - Re-render your document

# Collaboration

## Collaborating with other researchers

Three scenarios :

* Your collaborators do _not_ use the R ecosystem (booh!)
* Your collaborators use the R ecosystem (woohoo!)
* You and your collaborators are hardcore nerds (git!)

## Collaborating with R-agnostic colleagues

* Knit your R-markdown code into a Word or OpenDocument file ... send it
* Collaborators can use _Track changes_ in wordprocessor and ... return it
* Manually transfer changes back to Rmd ... start over again

**Benefits**

* Simple
* No new tools to learn (?)
* Anyone can join in (?)
* Separation of comments and revisions

## Collaborating with R-agnostic colleagues

* Knit your R-markdown code into a Word or OpenDocument file ... send it
* Collaborators can use _Track changes_ in wordprocessor and ... return it
* Manually transfer changes back to Rmd ... start over again

**Drawbacks**

* Error prone
* Redundancy
* Messy versioning nightmare
* Focus shifts towards typesetting / presentation

## Collaborating with R users -- the simple way

* Get your Rmd files and ... send it
* Collaborators edit the Rmd directly and ... return it
* _Diff_ the two version of the Rmd file and ... merge them selectively

## Diff'ing two (or more) text files

* **Meld**
* Beyond compare
* Araxis merge
* P4Merge
* DeltaWalker
* (RStudio)
* ..and others

There are also several online version .. e.g. **https://editor.mergely.com/**

...you probably should not upload sensitive information though.

## Collaborating with R users -- the simple way

* Get your Rmd files and ... send it
* Collaborators edit the Rmd directly and ... return it
* _Diff_ the two version of the Rmd file and ... merge them selectively

**Benefits**

* Relatively simple
* New tools are easy learn
* Anyone can join in
* Only one file type -- no knitting
* Focus remains on content

## Collaborating with R users -- the simple way

* Get your Rmd files and ... send it
* Collaborators edit the Rmd directly and ... return it
* _Diff_ the two version of the Rmd file and ... merge them selectively

**Drawback**

* Still some redundancy (Rmd file versions)
* Messy versioning nightmare
* Comments and revisions are not clearly separated 

# Documenting _process_

<!-- -->

## Collaborating with tech savvy nerds

...enter _GIT_ and _renv_

## R package _renv_

Not very difficult at all.

>- Maintains a library of R packages _along_ with r code
>- Updates to R and packages does not break your project
>- Permits you to come back in 5 years and re-execute your code

https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html

## GIT

It is a bit difficult.

>- Instead of storing multiple versions of the same file ...
>- ..it stores just the one file, **and** a (hidden) version-history
>- Changes are handled by Diff'ing versions

>- All changes (process) are documented
>- All changes (process) are reversible
>- Projects are _forkable_ and _mergable_

>- indispensable for LARGE projects
>- GIT is a separate program, supported by RStudio.

# Summary

<!-- -->

## Summary

* Comment your code
* Comment your project
* Meaningful names
* Structured files/folders
* Human readable files
* SCRIPTED AUTOMATION !! 
* Split the process into 'chunks' (data / analyses / output)
* Split the code into files
* Split the code-in-files into chunks

## Later in your R journey: 

* Accessing databases directly (RedCAP, ao)
* Creating interactive websitesand documents
* Making graphs come alive with animations
* _Live_ data analyses dashboards
* ..and much much more (it can even order pizza)

## Getting help

* Google 
* Stackoverflow
* Stackoverflow -- R4PHD
