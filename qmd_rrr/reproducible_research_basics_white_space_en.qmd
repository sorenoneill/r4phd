# Using white space

In MarkDown, 

* in the middle of text: multiple spaces = a single space 
* at the end of text: space + new-line = new-line + empty-line

::: panel-tabset

## Markdown

Look at this MarkDown, before clicking the next tab...

```
In markdown, there's an important difference
between '_new-line_' and '_empty-line_'.

...white space is important.

```

## Output

Look at the output from the MarkDown, before clicking the last tabs...

In markdown, there's an important difference
between '_new-line_' and '_empty-line_'.

...white space is important.

## Good practice

* any number of spaces between words is equal to one space
* any number of empty lines between paragraphs is equal to one empty line
* use one space to separate functions, operators, etc `a%>%b` vs `a %>% b`
* use empty line to indicate new paragraph

Go back and forth between the first two tabs, and look closely at the white space...
