## Is you computer an older model?

If your computer is an older model, we recomment that you get someone to help you install R well in time _before_ the R-course.

Otherwise, you risk spending all your class time wrangling your computer instead of playing with R.

The R-ecosystem is constantly developing and new functionality is added all the time, which may be unavailable to you with an older R installation.

Your computer doesn't have to be brand spanking new, but if in doubt, contact the teachers _before_ the R course starts.

At the time of writting (summer 2022) we reommend you use R version4.x.x and RStudio version 2022.x.x

## Was your computer supplied by SDU?

Be aware that the local IT department on the Regional Hospitals and the Universiy may impose certain restrictions on your ability to install software on your computer:

-   Access to some webpages (e.g. CRAN) may be restricted, as may access to download some files from the internet.
-   Installation of software may require particular administrative rights which you do not have as standard.

If this is the case, it will impede and slow down your installation of R.

It is therefor a good idea, to get all of this sorted out _before_ the start of classes. Again, otherwise you risk spending all your class time wrnagling your computer rather than playing with R.

...and we (the teacher) will gladly help you with the R-ecosystem, but not necessarily your computer or your operating system.
