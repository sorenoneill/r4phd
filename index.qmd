## Welcome to R4phd

The idea behind this webpage was to form the basis for regular classroom teaching of R, RStudio and the R ecosystem. Primarily with Ph.D. courses based at the University of Southern Denmark in mind.

You will find a plethora of guides, examples, videos and FAQs on the internet, but it can be difficult to naviagte and it is not structured for classroom teaching.

<hr>

You can start by looking at the table of content in the collapsable menu (top-left hand corner).

## How to use this website

## Operating system -- Windows, MacOS or Linux?

The teaching material on this site was prepared mainly on a Linux computer.

If you use Microsoft Windows or Apple MacOS you should expect things to look sightly different here, from how they appear on your own screen.

It should not give rise to any important issues however, as R and RStudio work very well and almost identically on all three operating systems. None-the-less, where I am aware of any real differences between the operating systems, I will illustrate it using three tabs in the following way (click the relevant tab):

::: panel-tabset

### Windows

...Windows specific content

### MacOS

...MacOS specific content

### Linux

...Linux specific content

::: 

## Exercises

On occasion you will find small exercises in collapsible boxes, like this:

(Click the collapsible box below):

:::{.callout-note collapse=true}

### Exercise #1

**If there are important differences between Windows, MacOS and Linux, you can find the information relevant to you:**

* In a separate window marked by a warning-triangle
* In one of three tabs marked with the operating system
* On a postcard on the fridge in the canteen

:::

... and similarly, the solution will be found in a collapsible box:

:::{.callout-note collapse=true}

### Solution to exercise #1

* ~~In a separate window marked by a warning-triangle~~
* **In one of three tabs marked with the operating system**
* ~~On a postcard on the fridge in the canteen~~

## Navigation

There are several ways to navigate between pages:

* In the left-hand side, you will find a table of content of pages by category
* At the end of every page in a section, you will find links to the preceding and following pages.
* A search function is available in the top-right hand corner

**Note** the links at the bottom of pages within a section:



## Comments and questions

It is possible to leave comments, suggestions and questions at the end of each page -- please help improve the R4PhD content by doing so:

* You will need a [github](GitHub) account, which can be created free of charge and which will probably come in handy at later time.
* Also note, that as pages on the R4PhD site are paired in English and Danish, comments will appear on both pages -- stick to English if possible.

We also recommend using [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) as great starting point for getting support when you run into trouble. We have created a [Stack Overflow for Teams](https://stackoverflowteams.com/c/r4phd/questions) group specifically for this class but, by all means, use the general Stack Overflow community -- you will find help is forthcoming _very_ quickly, if you can word your questions succinctly.

It is possible to create a separate account in Stack Overflow, or you can just log in using the GitHub account you just created (?) or alternatively a Google or Facebook account.
